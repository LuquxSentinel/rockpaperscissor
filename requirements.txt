1. Define Project Objectives and Scope:

Clearly define the objectives of the project, such as creating a simple game for users to play.
Determine the scope, including features like single-round play and, optionally, score tracking for multiple rounds.
2. User Input:

Prompt the user to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors). You can use Python's input() function for this.
Validate user input to ensure it matches the expected options.
3. Computer Selection:

Generate a random choice for the computer using Python's random module.
Ensure the computer's choice is also one of the valid options (rock, paper, or scissors).
4. Game Logic:

Determine the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice.
Implement the game logic where rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
Decide if it's a tie when both the user and computer make the same choice.
5. Display Result:

Display the user's choice and the computer's choice.
Display the result of the game, indicating whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie.
Optionally, display the score if you implement score tracking for multiple rounds.
